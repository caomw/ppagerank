Fast Parallel PageRank
======================

This code is based on those from our 2004 paper:
http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/dgleich/publications/gleich2004-parallel.pdf

It was reimplemented and can read Boldi-Vigna compressed graphs directly.

More details upon request! (Just make a new issue and I'll add details.)
